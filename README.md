## Sustainable Agriculture

**LeafLens** is an AI-driven solution that detects crop diseases from leaf images and provides **eco-friendly management advice**. It enables farmers, agronomists, and agricultural enthusiasts to monitor crop health efficiently while promoting sustainable practices.

> **Tagline:** LeafLens â€“ See your crops, save your crops. AI-powered insights, eco-friendly action.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features

- **Accurate Disease Detection** â€“ Detects 38 crop disease classes with high precision using a fine-tuned CNN model.  
- **Eco-Friendly Advice** â€“ Provides actionable recommendations without harming the environment.  
- **Batch & Single Image Prediction** â€“ Supports both bulk uploads and individual image analysis.  
- **Visual Insights** â€“ Displays disease predictions with images and Grad-CAM-like visualizations for explainability.  
- **Lightweight Deployment** â€“ Model exported to **TFLite**, ready for mobile and edge devices.  
- **Exportable Reports** â€“ Saves predictions and advice into CSV files for record-keeping.

## ðŸ”¹ Eco-Friendly Advice Examples

| Disease Class | Advice |
|---------------|--------|
| Apple___Apple_scab | Remove infected leaves. Apply sulfur-based fungicide. |
| Apple___Black_rot | Prune affected areas and maintain proper sanitation. |
| Apple___healthy | No action needed. Monitor regularly. |
| Tomato___Late_blight | Use copper-based sprays. Avoid overhead watering. |
| Tomato___Early_blight | Rotate crops and remove infected debris. |
