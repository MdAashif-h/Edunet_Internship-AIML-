ðŸŒ± LeafLens â€“ AI-Powered Eco-Friendly Crop Disease Detection






LeafLens is an AI-driven solution that detects crop diseases from leaf images and provides eco-friendly management advice. It enables farmers, agronomists, and agricultural enthusiasts to monitor crop health efficiently while promoting sustainable practices.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Accurate Disease Detection: Detects 38 crop disease classes with high precision using a fine-tuned CNN model.

Eco-Friendly Advice: Provides actionable recommendations without harming the environment.

Batch & Single Image Prediction: Supports both bulk uploads and individual image analysis.

Visual Insights: Displays disease predictions with images and Grad-CAM-like visualizations for explainability.

Lightweight Deployment: Model exported to TFLite, ready for mobile and edge devices.

Exportable Reports: Saves predictions and advice into CSV files for record-keeping.

ðŸ”¹ Supported Crops & Diseases

Apple: Apple Scab, Black Rot, Healthy

Tomato: Late Blight, Early Blight, Healthy

(Full list of 38 classes included in the model)

ðŸ”¹ Usage
Single Image Prediction
from predict import predict_and_visualize

img_path = 'path_to_leaf_image.jpg'
pred_class, confidence, advice = predict_and_visualize(img_path)

Batch Prediction
from predict import predict_batch_images

batch_results = predict_batch_images(folder_path='batch_images/')

Export TFLite Model
from export_model import export_tflite_model

export_tflite_model(model_path='models/fine_tuned_model.h5')
